## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

- **No content visible?**
  - Verify provider credentials
  - Check network connectivity
- **Missing metadata**
  - Normal for some providers
- **Deprecation warnings**
  - `ListItem.setInfo()` warnings do not affect playback
  - Migration to `InfoTagVideo` is planned
- **Provider differences**
  - Not all providers share the same API/URL structure; features can work on one host and fail on another
  - Open an issue with your host name/URL and API paths if something breaks so we can add support
